## Data Policy: Your Privacy, Our Commitment

### The Internet We Believe In

In a world where data is a commodity, we stand firmly against the tide. Our commitment is to protect your privacy and resist the surveillance capitalist machine. We don't believe in monetizing your data or turning your personal information into a product to be bought and sold. Here's how we practice what we preach.

### No Data Collection

We do not collect, store, or analyze your personal data. Period. We don't track your browsing habits, we don't use cookies to follow you around the web, and we certainly don't sell your data to the highest bidder. Your digital footprint remains yours alone.

### Email List: Your Consent, Your Control

We maintain an email list to keep you informed about our latest news, updates, and actions. This list exists solely because you chose to join it. Here's how we handle it:

- **Voluntary Subscription**: You join our email list because you want to, not because we trick you with dark patterns or default opt-ins.
- **Your Data, Your Rights**: You can unsubscribe at any time. When you do, your email address is permanently deleted from our records.
- **No Sharing, No Selling**: We will never share your email address with third parties. Your information is not for sale.

### Radical Transparency

We believe in radical transparency. Our operations are open for scrutiny, and we invite you to hold us accountable. If you ever have questions or concerns about your privacy, we encourage you to reach out and engage with us.

### A Different Kind of Internet

We're fighting for a different kind of internetâ€”one that respects privacy, fosters genuine connections, and stands against the commodification of our lives. By refusing to participate in data capitalism, we aim to create a space where you can engage without fear of surveillance or exploitation.

### Solidarity in Privacy

We are in solidarity with all who resist the erosion of privacy. Together, we can build an internet and a liberation movement that serves people, not NGOs and certainly not the capitalists.


Thank you for standing with us in creating a more just and equitable digital world.

In solidarity,

The Good Shepherd Collective

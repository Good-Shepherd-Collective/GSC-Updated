## Resisting Injustice and Dismantling Settler-Colonialism

Good Shepherd Collective's work towards liberation is rooted in the grassroots struggle within Palestine. Like other Indigenous movements resisting imperialism, it seeks to reclaim the material and political resources to self-govern. 

### Our Approach

- **Antizionist**: Any lasting work has to be anchored in decolonial thought. We see antizionism as decolonization. 

- **Community Mobilization**: Using direct action and grassroots organizing, we work within our communities to build powerful networks of resistance and solidarity for Palestinian liberation.

- **Campaigns & Actions**: We organize and execute high-impact, disruptive campaigns and actions that directly challenge settler-colonialism and neoliberal identity politics, amplifying Palestinian voices.

### Our modes of advocacy

- **Political Resistance**: Work within and beyond existing political formations to support and create new emergent groups that directly confront oppressive power structures.

- **Liberatory Education**: We develop and promote radical educational programs that center decolonial and antizionist critiques, raising consciousness and empowering action.

- **Grassroots Organizing**: Foster grassroots organizing and coalition-building to create a unified, radical front against settler colonialism and for Palestinian liberation.

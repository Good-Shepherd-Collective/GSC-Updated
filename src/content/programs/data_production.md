program: Data Production
description: Amid the propaganda of war, there is a critical need for data-informed analysis. This is particularly vital in the case of Israel's genocide in Gaza, where disinformation and propaganda dominate Israeli and much of the international media. These sources propagate outright lies and racist claims about Palestinians and, sow distrust in official Palestinian channels of information and statistics and ultimately legitimize ethnic cleansing. This diminishes organizers' ability to access and utilize this information in their advocacy â€” something desperately needed now.

## Data Democratization for Advocacy

The broader grassroots movement needs to have data readily available and accessible to process for their activism. The Good Shepherd Collective helps ensures this happens. 

### Our Approach

- **Accessibility**: Data is often inaccessible, trapped in PDF forms or structured in ways that are difficult to use on websites. We ensure data is provided in three formats: .csv, .xlsx, and .json endpoints.

- **Centralization**: We centralize data from various sources, making it easily accessible to activists, researchers, and community organizers in one place.

- **Updated**: We routinely monitor datasets and coordinate with their producers to ensure accuracy and timeliness.

### Applications

- **Grassroots Organizations**: Empowering local activists with accurate data to support their advocacy and organizing efforts.

- **Academics and Researchers**: Providing reliable data for scholarly research and analysis on the Palestinian struggle.

- **Journalists**: Equipping media professionals with verified data to counter disinformation.

program: Protective presence
description: Returning the land and resources back to the indigenous people in a way that is decoupled from capitalism is the ultimate goal of antizionist organizing. As such, the collaboration between Palestinians and international volunteers to harvest olives and protect their lands from settlers is vital for several reasons. First, it helps to keep them on the land. This cooperation ensures the preservation of a critical source of livelihood for Palestinian families, as olive farming is a significant economic and cultural activity in the region. Additionally, it fosters a sense of solidarity and global awareness about the challenges faced by Palestinian communities under occupation. The presence of international volunteers can help deter violent actions from settlers, providing a safer environment for the farmers. This united effort not only supports the immediate economic needs but also reinforces the broader struggle for land rights, justice, and peace in the region.

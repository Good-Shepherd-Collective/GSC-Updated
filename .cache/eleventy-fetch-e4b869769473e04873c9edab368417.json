This campaign highlights the importance of Palestinian unity by drawing on a long history of intercommunity support during challenging periods, including the olive harvest which consists of long, hot, tedious days of work.</p>\n<p>Activists and organizers from across the West Bank and Israel gathered in support of private landowners in the Huwara area such as Mahmoud Abu Ehab, harvesting olives in two locations. The first harvest location and our work there was met with relative quiet, and eventually, we moved to the second location in an area called Lihif Huwara, close to the Itzar outpost high up on the hilltop. Minutes after beginning to harvest the olives, settlers, and hilltop youth appeared, threatening the landowner and activists there to provide a protective presence. When Palestinians persisted in the work of harvesting the olives from their own trees, verbally expressing their intentions and disinterest in provoking the settlers, the hilltop youth responded with violence, hurling large stones downhill at activists and targeting older Palestinian men and women. Ultimately, at least four activists were harmed either by direct hits from the large stones or other forms of physical violence from the settlers. At least one activist ended up in the hospital for his injuries. Once soldiers arrived, they did very little to stop the settlers’ stone-throwing, instead of setting off stun grenades in the direction of activists that ultimately started large fires on swaths of the land and forcing the Palestinians and accompanying activists back down the hill.</p>\n<p>The behavior of the soldiers and settlers, as captured in our videos, make several things clear. First and foremost, Palestinian attempts to reclaim their land and fulfill their economic needs will be met with violence--unhinged, potentially fatal acts of violence carried by these organized bands of young men <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/goodshepherdcollective/posts/715879399000019\">who brag to their followers about their “success,” as we saw only weeks ago</a>. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, the military and border police coordinate in order to protect the settler population, never preventing violence against Palestinian civilians but rather deescalating tensions until things like closed military orders can be brought forth, forcing Palestinians to make a choice between further violence--beatings, arrests, and who knows what else--and leaving their land once again. </p>\n<p>Then again, it is these moments--tense, yet quiet moments when the soldiers and settlers are on one side and Palestinians and allies on the other, that much of the work gets done. As soldiers awaited the papers to confirm that the area could be closed to civilians, one of the Palestinian elders led by continuing to pick olives, dumping them into a bucket as she patiently explained to a young Israeli soldier that this was privately owned land which never belonged to the local settlers, and that we should be able to carry out our work. Reminding us of the quiet steadfastness with which we continue to move forward despite seemingly endless obstacles, she embodied what we do in these quiet moments in which we reject settler-colonial timelines and roles, refuse to be sucked into anxiety or scared out of action, and simply keep going with what must be done. As we continue to do the work to move us closer to justice, we know that connecting Palestinians across space and arbitrary legal differences is some of the most important work we can do. It is an honor to stand in solidarity with our partners in the struggle, Palestinian, Israeli, and international alike. </p>\n<p>You can learn more about the Faz3a campaign <a href=\"https://www.firefund.net/defendharvest\">here</a>.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On October 7, 2020 two core members of the Good Shepherd Collective headed to the Huwara area of Nablus in the West Bank with members of the South Hebron-based organization Youth of Sumud in order to support the launch of the Faz3a campaign.

Rather, this plan further entrenches both flaws by prioritizing Israeli hegemony, sovereignty, and ethnocracy at the expense of Palestinians’ right to self-determination, security, democracy, and access to resources. Palestinian civil society has made its collective rejection of this “peace” plan clear through protest and a resounding refusal to continue to accept another conception of the future which fails to secure individual and collective needs and rights.</p>\n<p>Trump’s “peace” plan includes extending Israeli sovereignty over the principal settlements throughout the West Bank and the Jordan Valley - the fertile region of Historic Palestine. Palestinian spaces would, in effect, turn into bantustans, joined by bridges (or a 25 mile long tunnel, connecting Gaza to a disjointed West Bank), over which Israeli security would reign supreme despite any pretense of an independent Palestinian state. This, like other “peace” proposals which have come before it, illustrates the settler-colonial mentality present in those making these proposals. This mentality leads to endless claims that one group of people’s right to “security” supersedes another group’s claims to the most basic of human rights, including safety. We at GSC reject this notion, rooted in the knowledge that we are all equal and thus deserve the same opportunities and access to rights, freedoms, and resources without privilege to one ethnicity, religion, race, sex, orientation, or based on any other arbitrary feature.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, this proposal highlights a shortcoming of our own movements of justice: the continued belief that citing international bodies of law and the organizations intended to uphold them will bring about radical change. While many cling to the hope of rights, protections, and decisions outlined in international law and United Nations decisions (and rightly so to a certain extent, as they outline the minimal guarantees we should all enjoy), it is important to acknowledge that international mechanisms based on state sovereignty and the expectation that politicians will hold each other accountable for violations are simply not expressed in practice.</p>\n<p>We cannot simply continue to react, to be on the defensive - we must shift our approach to be more proactive, choose reasonable targets, and change the law to protect all of our interests, rather than privilege some of us over others. In order to mobilize for change, we must remember our own power as organizers on the ground, sharing our resources among grassroots networks and building diverse coalitions usher in the future we all deserve.</p>\n<p>As an organization based in the South Hebron Hills, where many of the most heinous acts of indigenous elimination occur, GSC is grounded in the belief that unless our plans for justice center decolonization, they will not work toward any lasting peace.

The project's design incorporates an interactive component, asking Palestinian participants to construct from various materials their experiences of home demolitions and nonviolent resistance.

The activists present met with Minister Walid Assaf, built a tent in solidarity with the homes in Wadi al-Hummus on the other side of the wall under immediate threat of demolition, and carried out an action in which they marched toward the wall.</p>\n<p>Wadi al-Hummus is a neighborhood of Sur Baher that is currently under threat of one hundred home demolitions, approved by the Israeli High Court. Despite the fact that Sur Baher is under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, it is located on the Israeli side of the apartheid wall, beyond the jurisdiction of the Jerusalem municipality. This has brought up various fears--that Israel will use this precedent to extend their reach of demolitions into areas controlled by the PA, as well as the fear that Israel will continue to try to break up Palestinian-controlled areas by further disconnecting them from one another. Already, Areas A (meaning the areas under PA control) are separated into distinct enclaves, and the Israeli military has, in the past, carried out demolitions in these areas--usually as punitive home demolitions for the families of Palestinian alleged criminal suspects.</p>\n<p>During the march in protest toward the apartheid wall, the protesters were met by the border police. The border police began issuing a statement that if protesters continued to approach the wall they would be met with force, but before the statement was even issued in its entirety, the police began shooting tear gas canisters at the people. Although tear gas does not injure people exactly, it certainly can have a potent effect; Hajj Suleiman, one of the well-known village elders from Um al Khair, felt the impact strongly despite his as he desired to be in the midst of the protest and a part of the crowd. Many others felt the impact of the tear gas as well.</p>\n<p>The main message of the action came through clearly--Palestinians on both sides of the wall are one people. Despite Israel's persistent strategy of divide-and-conquer, the people on both sides of the wall wish to express solidarity with one another and will continue to envision their future as one people. Whether it is fighting the continued process of dispossession and displacement of Palestinians through demolitions--a blatant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention--or other racist practices, they will stand together, steadfast.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today, members of Good Shepherd Collective were invited to join an action in Sur Baher organized by the Committee Against the Wall and Settlements and the Popular Committee in South Hebron.

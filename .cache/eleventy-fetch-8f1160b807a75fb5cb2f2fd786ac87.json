Between January and the first few days of February, Israeli forces demolished 147 structures in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, displacing 210 people and affecting more than 3,600 total (UN OCHA). Among the structures, homes made up the most significant type of structure to be demolished, followed by agricultural structures and other buildings relating to livelihood.</p>\n<p>On February 2nd, Israeli forces demolished two homes belonging to brothers Muhammad Ali and Khaled Muleihat in Duma. In demolishing five structures, including a water well and a farmhouse, three families totaling 15 people — including nine children are homeless in the middle of the winter and rainy season. According to reports, the families had filed a legal injunction through JLAC to stop the demolitions, but the demolitions were carried out regardless.</p>\n<p>This demolition and displacement of these families resulted in the horrific video above, evoking memories of Palestinian displacement in the Nakba, Naksa, and the ongoing threat of ethnic cleansing for our communities across Palestine. Duma is a small community located southeast of Nablus city and surrounded by Israeli settlements. Like many other communities in Area C of the West Bank, its position and land make it a target for demolitions and attacks as part of a larger effort to displace the community and pave the way for a takeover of the land by Israeli settlers.</p>\n<p>This campaign of demolishing Palestinian homes while it has always been a key feature of the Israeli state. The current ultra right-wing political formations have gained new power in the Knesset, which has translated into new policy of hyper-displacement and settler violence. These ultra-right-wing political formations have been primarily financed by charitable funding from organizations registered in the US, Canada, the UK, and elsewhere. Find out more about what Palestinians are doing to combat the flow of charitable monies to right-wing Zionists groups. <a href=\"https://defundracism.org/\">Defundracism.org.</a></p>\n<h3>Regavim</h3>\n<p>In Khan al Ahmar, the village which has successfully resisted forced displacement amidst pressure from the Israeli state and settler organizations for four years, the situation has become increasingly tenuous again. With <a href=\"https://defundracism.org/regavim\">the ultra right-wing organization Regavim</a> continuously lobbying the courts to force the government to take violent action and destroy the community and the very settlers who are engaged in legal attacks and land takeovers in prominent government positions — now is the time for the international community to step up its support for the community.</p>\n<p>Eid al Khamis, a spokesman for the community, has stated that he believes the state has begun preparing for the demolition of the village and displacement of its residents, with settler leaders Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich considering this a top priority to move forward with the E1 settlement plans and finalizing Israeli control over all of the Jerusalem area. On January 23, a tour of the area by Likud members resulted in their public call for the destruction of the village. While there is a delay, many believe that the forced displacement of the 200 community members may be forthcoming within the year. While al Khamis has reiterated the community's determination to remain, he has also described the trauma and anxiety its Palestinian residents face under the weight of the possible ethnic cleansing, &quot;Everyone here is apprehensive. The residents cannot sleep or rest, especially the children and women&quot;.</p>\n<p>Read more about Khan al Ahmar <a href=\"https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20230117-over-200-palestinians-at-risk-of-forced-eviction-in-khan-al-ahmar/\">here.</a></p>\n<p>Read more about Regavim, the settler organization pushing for Khan al Ahmar and many other communities' displacement, and what you can do here: <a href=\"https://defundracism.org/\">defundracism.org</a></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yesterday Israeli forces demolished two Palestinian homes in Duma belonging to local residents Mohammad Ali and Khaled Muleihat.

While some of those kidnapped have returned to describe unimaginable torture, murder, being left out in the cold while essentially naked, used as human shields, and deprived of food and water for days, many more remain captives in unknown locations. Several of those kidnapped have been identified as well-known members of the community, including teachers, principals, journalists, and grocers. It is clear that Israeli forces are trying to manufacture images of victory by <a href=\"https://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/6023/Field-executions,-torture,-and-threats-of-rape:-In-Gaza,-Israel%E2%80%99s-army-replicates-the-crimes-committed-by-Zionist-gangs-in-1948\">pretending that these civilians are resistance forces who have surrendered</a>.</p>\n<p>Anas al Sharif, a courageous Al Jazeera journalist, has also uncovered details of Israeli massacres over the last weeks. He is reporting from northern Gaza, where media coverage has been incredibly sparse and even cell phone service has been cut repeatedly. Al Sharif reported <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Shepherds4Good/status/1733612486543249624\">the horrific massacre of dozens of Palestinians</a> who were inside al Yaman al Saeed hospital, inside Jabaliya refugee camp, when it was bombed by Israeli forces and set on fire. Dozens of Palestinians were unable to get out of the hospital, either because they were patients who could not move or were physically disabled, burned to death. Al Sharif and his family have received threats from Israeli forces for his brave insistence on reporting the vile actions of Israeli forces. This culminated in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLoUe7Ln_6E\">bombing of his home and the murder of his father earlier today</a>. Anas is still alive and pledged to continue reporting.</p>\n<p>On December 7, Israeli forces targeted and struck the home of a woman named Asmaa in Gaza City, the sister of well-known academic, writer, poet, organizer, and truth-teller <a href=\"https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/tamara-nassar/refaat-alareer-was-assassinated-israel\">Refaat Alareer</a>. Refaat, Asmaa, their other brother, Salah, and his son Mohammed were all murdered, along with three of Asmaa’s children, Yahia, Alaa, and Mohammad. After his death, journalists uncovered that Israeli forces had called and threatened Refaat, making it clear that they would kill him. Many of us around the world knew or knew of Refaat and were deeply moved not only by <a href=\"https://www.newarab.com/news/gaza-poet-refaat-alareers-words-live-new-translations\">his poetry</a> and incisive political analysis but also by his refusal to bend his principles in the face of violence and death.

As the international community rises up in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, as well as those of us in Palestine, many wonder what they can do after the demonstrations disperse. We know that a ceasefire alone will not make Gaza or Palestine free. <strong>Nonetheless, before reading on, allies should begin by reaching out to their representatives to demand an immediate ceasefire, as well as an end to the siege on Gaza, the implementation of the right of return for all Palestinian refugees, and the decolonization of Palestine. Be sure to call and send them emails daily to build consistent pressure.</strong></p>\n<p>Beyond this essential call, we have outlined a few potential action items that solidarity partners can take to support Palestinians in our struggle for liberation.</p>\n<p>Some of these action items are long-term goals and lifestyle changes revolving around education and openness in the face of censorship. Others are more specific suggestions of actions one might take, personally or as part of a group.</p>\n<p>      <strong>1. Educate yourself.</strong> </p>\n<p>Regarding Palestine, zionist settler colonialism, and indigenous resistance, much of our history has been obscured or hidden not only by Israel, but by those who support colonialism and imperialism today. Most people don't know it in detail, and that isn't their fault. You don't have to be an expert in anything to see right from wrong. But it is good to learn about zionism, settler colonialism, Palestinian history and indigenous resistance because the implications and connections stretch globally.</p>\n<p>Because so much of Palestinian history has been intentionally obscured, this means that daily events are often hidden, not reported by mainstream news, or misrepresented. While engaging in Palestine solidarity actions, you can learn the basics from the rich content provided by Palestinian resources, such as <a href=\"https://decolonizepalestine.com/\">Decolonize Palestine</a> and Let's Talk Palestine, which share <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/1RzlZDfxFff8_eAGWEDba2zgmq2oZ75Ya?usp=sharing\">sources</a> and a <a href=\"https://tr.ee/EI0NIKiLf6\">podcast</a>. You can also check out these reading lists for more suggestions by <a href=\"https://palestinianyouthmovement.com/reading-list\">the Palestinian Youth Movement</a> and <a href=\"https://decolonizepalestine.com/reading-list/\">Decolonize Palestine</a>. Academic authors on colonialism also have much to offer, such as Fayez Sayegh, Ghassan Kanafani, and Frantz Fanon.</p>\n<p>      <strong>2. Educate others.</strong> </p>\n<p>We can't change the world alone — we need our communities to join us in the fight for justice. We are also responsible for each other. That means having difficult conversations with your family, friends, colleagues, and so on, in addition to confronting politicians and elected representatives. It's uncomfortable, and it can require a lot of humility — no one knows the answer to every question off the top of their head — but at the same time, no one can carry this weight alone. By educating others, we build communities for ourselves that make the struggle less overwhelming. We also create mechanisms of accountability.</p>\n<p>      <strong>3. Speak out.</strong></p>\n<p>For a hundred years, Palestinians have been systematically silenced, imprisoned, tortured, attacked, and murdered for speaking the truth about our community, history, families, and even our personal experiences. Brilliant Palestinians have had their jobs taken away from them for standing by their principles. As the pressure to maintain the status quo works to silence Palestinians and allies, flatten Palestinian resistance, and tear apart solidarity efforts, particularly through intimidation, raise your voice. We must stand by each other, insist on truth and dignity, and refuse to be cowed into silence. </p>\n<p>      <strong>4. Take action.</strong></p>\n<p>It's not enough to just talk about Palestine and the struggle for liberation or to educate others—though these are essential steps. Action needs to be taken. This could be through holding demonstrations in front of embassies, representatives' and politicians' offices, or protesting in front of the buildings of companies supporting Israeli settler colonialism. This could also mean organizing events, banner drops, vigils, or building archives of information or shorter materials to distribute in your local community. Below are some examples of meaningful actions you can take.</p>\n<p>                    <strong>a. Join meaningful and impactful campaigns.</strong></p>\n<p>Often, when we think about liberation, the goal seems enormous and beyond reach. But we can begin with campaigns in our communities, taking on options that are winnable and impactful, and change the world to start to reflect justice. There are many ways that we can trace connections between our international communities and those in Palestine to begin to undo zionist infrastructure in our communities. This can be targeting the funding of Israeli settler organizations, as has been done with the <a href=\"http://defundracism.org\">Defund Racism campaign</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.palestineaction.org/\">Palestine Action</a>, which directly disrupts companies involved in Israeli military violence.</p>\n<p>You can also consider building your own campaigns, such as withholding donations from your elected officials or their parties until they meet certain demands, such as supporting a ceasefire and calling for an end to the siege on Gaza. Never forget the power that you can exercise locally, and find the most effective ways you can both <em>win</em> your campaign and have a direct <em>impact</em> in Palestine. </p>\n<p>                    <strong>b. Boycott</strong></p>\n<p>A simple way to take action for Palestine is to follow the Palestinian call for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions against Israel. Check out the <a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net/get-involved/what-to-boycott\">BDS guide</a> to think about which companies near you are relevant and engage your community in a boycott of organizations and companies that are supporting and investing in Israel. These could be anything from food companies like Starbucks, McDonald's, Papa Johns, KFC, Pizza Hut, or tech companies like HP, Oracle, Google, Amazon, and many others.</p>\n<p>                    <strong>c. Challenge your representatives.</strong></p>\n<p>Your representatives work for you, and speak in your name nationally and internationally. Neither you nor they should ever forget that. This means that you have a right and responsibility to demand that they meet a certain threshold of accountability to those they represent. One way you can immediately demand that your representative join the call for a ceasefire if you are in the US or Canada is by <a href=\"https://actionnetwork.org/letters/gaza-ceasefire-call-to-end-the-siege-pressure-campaign/\">sending a letter pledging not to financially support them</a> or their political party until they publicly and meaningfully support this demand. We must use all of the resources at our disposal, including our own financial contributions, to make politicians stand on the side of justice.</p>\n<p>Beyond this tool, whether you want to cultivate a close relationship with your elected representatives or an antagonistic one, find what is effective and use it. This can include regularly contacting their offices to express your opinion, having conversations with staffers about specific issues, organizing sit-ins and protests to procure a statement from them, and so on.</p>\n<p>      <strong>5. Join local groups and commit to long-term solidarity.</strong></p>\n<p>We know that the battle for justice and the process of decolonization doesn't happen overnight. What Palestinians need goes beyond the solidarity of days and weeks when the colonial violence is at its peak, as it is right now. Palestinians need solidarity in our anti-colonial struggle in the long term.</p>\n<p>One great way to do this is by finding and joining a local group in your community that aligns with these values and meaningfully challenges the structures underpinning Israeli colonialism. If one doesn't exist, you can create one. Local groups can keep each other motivated, organize demonstrations, lead local campaigns, educate the larger community, organize events to raise awareness and build power over time to sway local representatives.</p>\n<p>      <strong>6. Don't pay taxes that contribute to genocide.</strong></p>\n<p>If you know your taxes are going to support genocide or the occupation of Palestinian people, and you want to take a calculated risk to make a stand, refuse to pay your taxes. The US government invests around 10 million dollars a day in Israel, mostly in military aid, in the promotion of more apartheid, killing, displacement, and land-grab. Organize a national campaign to refuse to pay taxes to the government until it completely stops supporting the Israeli government, army, and organizations. Be loud and proud; be as public as you safely can be so that the government cannot target individuals but instead must address a community of citizens refusing to fund genocide.</p>\n<p>      <strong>7. Don't share propaganda.</strong></p>\n<p>Since October 7, Israeli media and media coming out of colonial and imperial power centers have peddled fake news: babies killed and beheaded, rape accusations, Hamas rockets bombing al Ahli hospital, Hamas headquarters under al Shifa hospital, schools, and so on. This propaganda only serves Israeli interests and distracts from the ongoing genocide of 2.2 million people living in an open-air prison. It is imperative not to take for granted every piece of information that Western media spreads, as some journalists report things that they have only heard and report them as facts when they come from Israeli sources without any verification. On the other hand, they treat news from Palestinian sources as untrustworthy and provide qualifications, if they report it at all.</p>\n<p>How to spot fake news? Consult the <a href=\"https://arabfcn.net/en/home/\">Arab Fact-Checkers Network</a>, which works towards fostering transparent fact-checking and combating fake news in the Arab region.</p>\n<p>If you are still determining if something is verified news or not, wait to make up your mind before sharing it. </p>\n<p>      <strong>8. Invest meaningfully — time, resources, money, effort.</strong></p>\n<p>Solidarity in struggle means sacrifice. Sacrifice can come in time, money, other resources, effort, etc. When it comes to making donations giving your time or energy to an organization, make sure that your investment is going to have the desired outcome. This may mean different things for charities as opposed to advocacy organizations.</p>\n<p>Both types of organizations can easily be researched, as both usually publish annual reports. You can also find analyses on charities and reports about how effective and transparent they are. If you want to donate to aid in Gaza, there are many credible platforms. <a href=\"https://nordiskhjalp.org/ar/solidarity-with-gaza-nour/?fbclid=PAAaYxI7bm0iqlvlJB7rENWqgt2F1e4Mm7C8_m3yheaomZ9BucUwGusRiuaW0\">Here</a> is one.</p>\n<p>You can also donate to Palestinian Children's Relief Fund, Médecins Sans Frontières, and many more.</p>\n<p>When it comes to advocacy organizations that claim to work on behalf of the Palestinian people or in solidarity, take your time to consider the impact of the organizations' work. Read their annual reports. Read about which campaigns they support or have organized, and what the tangible outcomes have been — not only wherever they are based, but in Palestine itself.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Right now, Palestinians in Gaza are grappling with the horrific reality imposed by Israel&#8217;s siege and constant bombing.

From protective presence in communities and planting olives to developing advocacy initiatives and local organizing, we work directly with local Palestinian groups resisting Israeli settler-colonialism and apartheid. Supporting in tangible ways means being physically present, providing legal and political analysis, facilitating financial support, and overcoming often overlooked obstacles in movement work such as technology development. </p>\n<p>Having a digital presence is absolutely critical when advancing a movement of liberation. Millions of Palestinians and the solidarity movement around them turn to social media channels every day to advocate for a free Palestine. They use these tools to highlight the mechanisms of Israeli ethnic cleansing. But with Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok censoring critical voices, individuals and political formations in Palestine must develop their digital organizing tools, such as websites for international organizing and advocacy. However, when Palestinians are facing eviction, having their homes demolished, their children imprisoned and killed — community organizers who are on the front lines confronting Israeli violence simply don't have the additional capacity to develop and optimize websites, deal with security and monitoring concerns, or have the programming background fix problems when they arise. The Good Shepherd Collective is stepping in to fill this need.</p>\n<p>Without a website, local groups lose the ability to fully represent themselves. There is not a static, consistent space for them to tell their unique stories or outline the ways solidarity groups can contribute directly in meaningful ways. For example, Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok don’t offer options to build email lists, book tours, and webinars, or the infrastructure to collect online donations. These are all fundamental tools that these local organizations in Palestine need to have at their disposal to build a community of support for their important work. At the moment, local Palestinian villages and community organizers rely on outside groups to facilitate many of these important resources, disrupting their autonomy. This enables liberal Zionist groups and international legacy NGOs to engage in “resource capture”. </p>\n<p>Take, for example, a community under siege and facing home demolitions. NGOs and liberal <a href=\"https://cjnv.org/\">Zionist groups</a> run massive international campaigns with a community like this at the center, rallying a broad base of support from across different movement spaces to sign petitions, organize protests, and apply pressure to political actors to momentarily sway the Israeli state’s behavior toward this community. In the end, what happens is that the community may or may not achieve some temporary relief, such as an injunction on a home demolition, while the Zionist cohabitation groups and liberal NGOs have now captured hundreds of thousands of emails — all people who are sympathetic to the cause and willing to donate. But since these local Palestinian villages have no way to collect the emails themselves, the technology to mass communicate directly with their base of support through email or SMS, Palestinian organizers and communities lose out on these necessary material resources. The Good Shepherd Collective is dedicated to supporting local groups in developing the necessary tools to reclaim these resources and receive the support that is actually intended for them.</p>\n<p>Most recently we <a href=\"https://youthofsumud.org\">developed a website for Youth of Sumud</a>, a small grassroots group based in Masafer Yatta using serverless architecture. Serverless architecture and static sites have gained popularity in recent years due to their high performance and numerous benefits for SEO and user experience. This approach to web development is gaining traction for many reasons, including scalability, cost-effectiveness, and ease of deployment — which are all important for Palestinian community organizers that need to add additional advocacy tools to their work.</p>\n<p>One reason the GSC uses serverless architecture is that it enables us and our partners to develop and run code without micro-managing the underlying infrastructure. The cloud provider handles all the server management, including scaling and maintenance, and developers only pay for the resources they use — making it an incredibly cost-effective approach.</p>\n<p>One of the main benefits of serverless architecture is its speed. Since the serverless provider manages the infrastructure, the server can respond to requests much faster than traditional server architectures. This means that static sites hosted on serverless architecture can be delivered quickly, resulting in faster load times, a critical factor for SEO and user experience. In fact, the Youth of Sumud website, the first one we've built, has nearly a perfect Light House Score. </p>\n<p>The lighting speed is inherent in static site generation, as the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are served directly to the user without any server-side processing. Since there is no server-side processing, the site can be delivered much faster than traditional dynamic websites (like WordPress sites), resulting in faster load times and a better user experience.</p>\n<p>But more than just high performance, security is at the center of our development. With Israeli deploying spyware, routine hacking, security is a major factor in building a digital presence with serverless technology. </p>\n<p>Serverless functions and static sites are inherently more secure than traditional web applications that run on a server. Here are some ways that this architecture makes it harder for a website to be hacked:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Reduced Attack Surface: Traditional web applications are composed of multiple layers such as the server, database, web application server, etc., and all these layers have their own vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers. In contrast, serverless functions and static sites have a minimal attack surface since there are no servers to manage, no operating systems to patch, and no databases to manage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stateless Architecture: Serverless functions are stateless, which means that they do not maintain any state between requests. This makes it difficult for an attacker to hijack a session or carry out a denial-of-service attack, as each request is handled independently.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Limited Access: Serverless functions typically run in a sandboxed environment, meaning they have limited access to system resources and can only access the resources they need to execute their code. This reduces the potential attack surface and limits the impact of a security breach.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Automatic Scaling: Serverless functions and static sites are designed to scale automatically based on incoming traffic. This means there is no need to provision additional resources to handle spikes in traffic, which can introduce vulnerabilities if the resources are not properly configured.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Third-Party Libraries: Serverless functions and static sites often rely on third-party libraries and services, which are maintained by dedicated teams of developers and are regularly updated to fix security vulnerabilities. This reduces the burden on individual developers to maintain and update their own code, which can be a significant source of vulnerabilities.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Additionally, SEO is another critical factor where serverless architecture and static sites excel. One of the most important factors for SEO is the site's speed, and serverless architecture and static sites offer blazing-fast loading times. Furthermore, static sites have a simple structure, making it easy for search engines to crawl and index. This will result in better search engine rankings, which will drive more organic traffic to our partners' sites.</p>\n<p>As we've laid out, serverless functions and static sites offer a more secure architecture for web applications, with a reduced attack surface, stateless architecture, limited access, automatic scaling, third-party libraries, and serverless security. By leveraging these features, we can focus on building robust digital tools for our partners on the ground.</p>\n<p>Serverless architecture and static sites offer numerous benefits for SEO and user experience. They are scalable, cost-effective, easy to deploy, and highly secure. They also offer fast loading times, which is a critical factor for both SEO and user experience. Therefore, it is critical to consider serverless architecture and static sites when building websites within our movement to ensure optimal performance and user engagement. </p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Good Shepherd Collective continues to evolve to meet the needs of the movement for Palestinian liberation.

At the current rate, Israel will destroy almost 1,200 Palestinian homes and facilities by the end of the year. Since 2017, home demolitions have been steadily increasing every year. In 2017 there were 422 demolitions in the West Bank and Jerusalem, followed by 463 in 2018, 632 in 2019, 857 in 2020, 911 in 2021, and 952 in 2022.

This is illustrated not only with the rise in demolitions, killings, and the incarceration of Palestinians, but through absurd power grabs — such as Prime Minister Netanyahu gifting ultra-radical settler MK Itamar Ben Gvir his own personal militia. It is clear that the trajectory of Israeli politics is its consolidation into a religious theocracy. </p>\n<p>As the trend of violence and indigenous dispossession continue, the international solidarity movement needs to usher in a new liberatory praxis and utilize tactics that take aim at the structures of violence through policy change and legal reform. Contrary to popular belief, perpetual webinars and book readings will not lead to a future of Palestinian emancipation. No matter how well attended, these social events are not an end in themselves. International solidarity groups have to link their activities to winnable, impactful campaigns. The future of Palestine depends on it.</p>\n<p>This week, Regavim, an openly racist Israeli settler organization specializing in legal campaigns to lobby for Palestinian displacement, celebrated their most recent victory: a new demolition order for the Jubbet al-Dhib school in eastern Bethlehem.</p>\n<p>The Jubbet al-Dhib has long been a target of the zionist movement, destroyed in 2017, and its solar panels were previously confiscated by Israeli forces. For the last five years, they've exhausted resources to keep the school serving their embattled community.</p>\n<p>&quot;After a 5-year legal battle, we won a major judgment in the Jerusalem District Court in our petition against the Palestinian Authority's illegal school in the Herodion National Park,&quot; said Regavim's Social Media Coordinator, Sam Whitefield. &quot;The decision orders the illegal structure to be sealed off immediately, and demolished within 60 days.&quot;</p>\n<p>With millions of dollars funneled through U.S., Canadian, and U.K. charitable foundations, Regavims deploys field workers to surveil and document Palestinian construction and employs lawyers and lobbyists to build pressure in the Knesset to facilitate the erasure of the indigenous Palestinian population. This is manifested in acts such as home demolitions, land confiscations, and new laws that strip the original inhabitants of Palestine of their lands and fundamental rights. Regavim was a major advocate of the Nation-State law and is one of the leading voices calling for dismantling the Israeli court system in favor of one replaced by the radical settler movement.</p>\n<p>Regavim is one piece of a larger consortium that, against charitable regulations, has either set up ghost charities or partnered with suspect institutions to fund the colonization of Palestine.</p>\n<p>A broad base of Palestinian organizations and civic activists have called for the international solidarity movement to develop and execute their own localized campaigns to stop the financing of these settler organizations.

These numbers don't account for the number of demolitions that happen inside the Green Line in places like the Naqab or the Galilee regions as well as other non-Jewish communities.</p>\n<p>Organizations like Regavim, Ir David, the Hebron, and Ateret Cohanim have all funneled hundreds of millions of charitable donations through channels in the United States, Canada, and the U.K. to develop political programs that ushered in more robust, aggressive, and permanent policies that structured to erase Palestinian communities and replace them.</p>\n<p>These financial structures have been essential in financing the ultra right-wing government, with members of the aforementioned organizations all utilizing their previous organizations to make inroads into the government and ultimately gaining MK positions — like Bezalel Smotrich — the co-founder of Regavim.</p>\n<p>Dismantling the financial mechanisms that underpin the settler movement must take an elevated position within the Palestinian movement for liberation if we want to prevent the next Huwara.

When asked about this in an interview on Wednesday, March 1, Smotrich doubled down, calling for the state to carry out this eradication. He argued that he believes the state has an obligation to do this, not its settler citizens. He was not being facetious.</p>\n<p>Bezalel Smotrich, co-founder of Regavim, has spent most of his career dedicated to exactly what he described in this interview: the displacement and destruction of Palestinian communities. Through building relationships with the military, surveilling Palestinian communities, and lobbying for their destruction through court petitions and political engagement in the Knesset, Smotrich has worked hard to convince the state to increase its use of violence against vulnerable communities. Among the most prominent examples of his former organization’s targets are Khan al Ahmar — which is not facing potentially imminent displacement - and Khallet ad Dabe’, a small hamlet in Masafer Yatta that is also at immediate risk.</p>\n<p>Among other settler leaders like Itamar Ben Gvir and Yishai Fleisher (spokesman for the Hebron Fund), Smotrich is speaking openly and honestly about his hopes for the elimination of indigenous Palestinians. Palestinians know that we must take these threats seriously, and we need our allies to understand their significance. As structural and individual acts of violence mount against Palestinians and our communities, we must disrupt the international support going to the organizations mounting the pressure and making it ever more appealing for the state to move forward with drastic measures.</p>\n<p>Read more about Regavim, the settler organization pushing for Khan al Ahmar and many other communities' displacement, and what you can do here: <a href=\"https://defundracism.org/\">defundracism.org</a></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s critical to remember that while Israel&#8217;s use of home demolitions is a constant tool for indigenous displacement and erasure, the ebbs and flows of this formal policy’s execution are shaped by different political formations.

While these escalations are a pattern of the Israeli state, they have increased with the new far right Israeli coalition controlling the government.</p>\n<p>Last week Israeli forces stormed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Shepherds4Good/status/1628363151254204416\">Nablus</a> in broad daylight, entering a busy market in the center of the city and killing a total of eleven people. Among those murdered were a boy who was fleeing live fire, two elderly men, and Palestinians who were part of organized resistance. The Israeli forces injured more than a hundred more Palestinians during this massacre, using tear gas and shooting with live fire.</p>\n<p>In Palestine, as we—like many others—reported on this attack, tweeting about it live, we watched in horror as the number of Palestinians killed at the hands of Israeli forces continued to grow. Local residents shared clips of drones overhead, soldiers in the center of their city, live ammunition, and tear gas. This was an attack on a major city at a time when Israeli forces knew the area would be crowded and busy. It was no coincidence that so many Palestinians were injured, most of them by live ammunition.</p>\n<p>This is only the latest attack in a series. Since the beginning of the year, Israeli forces have carried out attacks in Jericho and Jenin which killed more than fifteen people combined in attempts to quash Palestinian resistance.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>On, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Shepherds4Good/status/1630275929153888257\">February 26</a>, Israeli settlers attacked Huwara, a Palestinian town south of Nablus. Nearby Huwara are many Israeli settlements and outposts with reputations for violent assaults on Palestinians–among them, <a href=\"https://www.alhaq.org/advocacy/17738.html\">Yitzhar</a>. Escorted by Israeli forces who served as armed protectors, hundreds of Israeli settlers poured into the town and burned between 30 and 100 cars, torched homes, and killed at least one Palestinian man. Many others were attacked, stabbed, shot, beaten, and many of those not attacked directly by settlers suffered from tear gas inhalation. Settlers are also reported to have attacked the nearby villages of Burin and Qaryout.</p>\n<p>Israeli politicians and public figures have rushed to distance themselves from this undeniably inhumane assault on Palestinians of all stripes—with Netanyahu notably asking citizens not to <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israel-sends-more-troops-into-occupied-west-bank-after-latest-wave-of-violence\">“take the law into their own hands”</a> after working to make guns more accessible to Israelis only a month ago. Still, claims that this violence is not the true character of the state, or that zionism is not based on violence and Jewish supremacy, are nothing but attempts to distort reality.</p>\n<p>The ongoing, mounting attacks by Israeli settlers and armed forces alike are only the latest iteration of Israeli colonial violence, which exists to forcibly displace Palestinians from their homeland through resource theft and violence. And while we could spend all day dissecting the racism underpinning the responses from American politicians such as State Department spokesman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Shepherds4Good/status/1630212516419719171\">Ned Price</a>, what Palestinians need is not another empty gesture, call for senators to apologize for meeting with Israeli politicians, or articulation that zionism is not Judaism. They certainly do not need allies to fundraise for the legacy NGOs in the global north.</p>\n<p>Palestinians need allies abroad to engage in processes that strip resources directly from the actors engaging in the destruction—political action that solidarity partners can begin in their own communities. This means going beyond education to effect change in our communities. While GSC and our partners on the ground have put forth the Defund Racism campaign to disrupt the funding going to organizations like the Hebron Fund—whose spokesperson affirmed that the settlers involved in the Huwara attack are zionists representing many Israelis—or Regavim, that is not the only way forward. But solidarity that remains in the form of words and sympathetic gestures is no longer enough.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As we move toward Ramadan this year, Israeli forces and settlers are ramping up violence against Palestinian communities everywhere.

One such central conflict, which was made clear throughout regular interactions between women within GSC, visiting interns, and international tourists and these men was the treatment of women. Over the years, GSC was made aware of accusations of inappropriate conduct carried out by Awdah and Tariq, ranging from sexual harassment, unwanted advances, and misconduct to an atmosphere of disregard for women’s safety and equality in organizing spaces. As an organization vehemently opposed to all forms of oppression and led in part by survivors of sexual assault and multifaceted violence/oppression, members within GSC attempted to respond to allegations of misogynistic behavior and sexual misconduct with internal efforts to ensure women’s safety in our shared workspaces. Simultaneously, we held conversations about the accusations with these men, offered cultural insight where it felt appropriate, and indicated what constitutes appropriate behavior in these interactions, particularly with foreign women. At the time, we believed that our former partners had an earnest interest in addressing these concerns and adjusting their behavior, and we felt that we were well-situated to support these efforts from a place of mutual support, rather than punishment, or disposability culture. It became clear over time, however, that this was not the case. The last incident that was brought to our attention happened in early 2020, shortly before we began our disengagement from these organizers. At this point, we felt it was clear that these individuals were not earnestly engaged in reflective processes or had any real intention to prioritize women’s safety and comfort in these spaces. In the last few years, we have emphasized our concerns privately to those still engaged in efforts to bring internationals into those spaces and house them in the village, urging them to prioritize the safety of these women.</p>\n<p><strong>Finances and fiscal sponsorship:</strong> In May of 2021, these men, in coordination with Israelis, organized an attempt to disrupt funding to the collective and contacted our fiscal sponsors with allegations of financial wrongdoing. After a review of the financial documents, our fiscal sponsor’s oversight mechanism concluded after an audit that the financial allegations were impossible. Coupled with an interview with other Palestinians working with GSC, our fiscal sponsors concluded that there were no financial wrongdoings and they remained committed to the broad Palestinian organizing that the GSC helps to facilitate. </p>\n<p><strong>GSC decision-making:</strong> The decision-making body has always been more than just one person, as is any decision-making structure aimed at building a participatory movement. GSC has always engaged in collective decision-making processes within the group, with deference to different kinds of expertise (e.g. fundraising; community dynamics).</p>\n<p>In addition, we have always and continue to rely on the analysis and advice of Palestinian organizers/activists on the ground where we are active, organizations, and local leadership to reach decisions. Contrary to the framing of the defamatory statements circulated by these men, our organization has never been led by one person holding an executive position, but rather all active members of the collective in dialogue about how to carry out our work within the framework of shared principles. Today, GSC organizing and decision making is done by the four people working within the GSC, three Palestinian women and one international within an anti-zionist and decolonial framework.</p>\n<p><strong>Disagreements:</strong> GSC has aligned its work with the guidelines of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement—specifically in regards to normalization. Since leaving GSC, these men have organized or been a part of joint initiatives alongside J Street and other liberal zionist organizations which clearly qualify as normalization. For example, their joint event “dedicated to” the beloved Hajj Suleiman with J Street—a zionist organization that openly advocates for advancing the US policy to invest in the arms trade with Israelis and is openly opposed to the BDS movement—crosses a clear red line outlined in the anti-normalization principles as expressed through a large cross-section of Palestinian society. This is just one example of engaging in normalization with zionist institutions.</p>\n<hr />\n<figure id=\"attachment_145\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-145\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://login.goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cjnv-and-jstreet.jpg\" alt=\"Former volunteers of the Good Shepherd Collective and residents of Um al-Khair held a joint memorial service with several zionist organizations, including J Street — an organization that advocates against BDS and supports US military aid to Israel.

While some believe that collaborating with zionist organizations is worthwhile (and the financial benefits that factor into that view cannot be ignored), GSC has steadfastly refused to do so. We are fully aware that settler-colonialism legitimizes itself and ultimately prevails through normalizing its presence. We find it self-defeating for the resistance when members of the colonized community cooperate with such organizations, since by doing so they empower the zionists to present themselves as the good guys, “supporting” the very oppressed population their ideology and less-“liberal” zionist colleagues are in fact repressing. These men, have in the past, and to this day, continue to align themselves with zionist organizations. </p>\n<p>Engaging in normalization is not only morally egregious but devastating in building Palestinian unity. It negates the possibility of building a broad movement of Palestinian organizations, villages, and community activists—an effort that the GSC has been able to do with dramatically increased effectiveness after decoupling the organization from these men. GSC’s position as an anti-normalization, anti-zionist organization is a central organizing feature of the larger coalition within which we work. Because of these organizing principles, we were able to push forward with a broad coalition of Palestinian organizations operating on the ground, including Youth of Sumud, the Hebron Defense Committee, the Community Peacemaker Teams, and the Human Rights Defenders.</p>\n<p><strong>Mediation:</strong> GSC requested the assistance of a Palestinian colleague, a well-known supporter of Um al Khair and an individual trusted by GSC, to facilitate communications following a coordinated attempt between these men and a zionist organization in 2021 to disrupt the organization’s funding. We made an honest effort to engage in this process of mediation, but it was ultimately unsuccessful because these men did not commit to the principles of the mediation process. For example, they continued to publicly attack GSC throughout the process.</p>\n<p>This attempt to disrupt our work at a time in which we are co-organizing a broad, anti-zionist campaign to defund the US-based charitable organizations sending millions of dollars each year in funding to Israeli settler organizations that affect the entire geography of Palestine is an attempt to set our coalition partners and us back by years. It is a spiteful attempt to smear our organization, and our long-dedicated allies, using identity politics and a misrepresentation of the history of this organization and our interactions with these individuals and the village of Um al Khair. </p>\n<hr />\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://login.goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/email2.png\" alt=\"Translation: A meeting was held with the Good Shepherd Collective and we&#039;ve looked into the work of the Good Shepherd Gollective and Defund Racism campaign and the councils had been made aware of unknown facts and issue and assure the public of their full support for the campaign and its continuity in Masafer Yatta.

Although we are no longer permanently based in Masafer Yatta, we continue to offer support and solidarity in these communities. After conversations with the heads of these councils, we were assured that this statement was signed approximately three years ago–around the time GSC split from these three men–under false pretenses. In the course of these conversations, these council heads have reaffirmed their support for GSC.</p>\n<p>We want to note as well that the false and misleading information provided in these statements is not limited to what has been printed about GSC. It’s important to note as well that the statement by the village councils, from what we have been made to understand through conversations with council members, was signed approximately three years ago.

Since the beginning of Ramadan, Israeli forces have intimidated Palestinians from worshiping at their holy site. As Palestinians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfjX4iOU2bY\">resisted colonial oppression</a> reclaiming their rightful presence on their land and sovereignty over their religious sites, Israeli forces responded by detaining and arresting hundreds of Palestinians in and around the Old City of Jerusalem.

These images and stories have to advance liberation. They have to be a mode of communication to activate advocacy initiatives built to dismantle Israel's program of colonization. These advocacy approaches have to be strategic, aimed at the policies and laws that allow Israel to maintain and build power and be more than &quot;educational.&quot; When thinking about our advocacy campaign, we have to ask ourselves two critical questions: What is the impact of the campaign, and is it winnable? Campaigns must both be achievable and have a material effect on the ground.</p>\n<p>Focusing on the laws that allow charities to fund the Israeli settler movement, the  <a href=\"https://defundracism.org\">Campaign to Defund Racism</a> is both winnable and has the potential to completely derail the financial structures that underpin the Israeli squatter initiative. The Campaign to Defund Racism is a call from the ground, a campaign developed by the most vulnerable Palestinian communities facing settler attacks and displacement. They have marked out which Israeli settler organizations are leading the charge for displacement and dispossession and offer up a clear path to organize to defund them. With <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-700700\">Regavim taking every legal and political route</a> to displace the people of Khan al-Ahmar,  <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-jerusalem-settlers-police-seize-historic-hotel-old-city\">Ateret Cohanim physically taking over the Petra Hotel</a> and the <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2021/05/14/israel-settler-evictions-jerusalem-nonprofits/\">Israel Land Fund and others waging war against the people of Sheikh Jarrah</a>, it is no wonder why Palestinians have made this call to defund Israeli settler organizations a national priority.</p>\n<p>You can help support this campaign by heading the <a href=\"https://defundracism.org\">Defund Racism</a> website, signing the petition, and sharing it on social media. You can make a step further by having your  <a href=\"https://defundracism.org/organizational-endorsement/\">organization endorse the call</a> as well as <a href=\"https://defundracism.org/host-a-webinar/\">organizing a webinar</a>.

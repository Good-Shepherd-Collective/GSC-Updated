Meanwhile, settlers and soldiers rampaged through Hebron, Nablus, and poured into the community of Jenin. As Jenin remains a target of Israeli violence, it's important to remember the horrors of the <a href=\"https://electronicintifada.net/content/jenin-wont-forget-israels-massacre/20221\">Jenin massacre</a> from two decades ago and how that history continues to impact the community.</p>\n<p>In 2002, the Israeli military executed an uncompromising campaign of violence across Palestinian communities, murdering nearly 500 and injuring 1,500 men, women, and children from March to May. On April 3, 2002, the Israeli launched a violent military operation into the Jenin refugee camp, which housed some 14,000 refugees. It was an act of Israeli violence that, even in the context of the Second Intifada, was unprecedented.</p>\n<p>The stories of the Jenin massacre represent the ultimate goal of Israel's program of settler colonialism: Indigenous elimination. Like every other settler-colonial society, whether it be Canada, the United States, or South Africa, the structure of settler-colonialism is designed to pursue the elimination of the Indigenous people — whether through violence, displacement, or assimilation — the goal is erasure.</p>\n<p>During the Israeli invasion of Jenin, much like today, <a href=\"https://www.dci-palestine.org/2021_is_deadliest_year_for_palestinian_children_since_2014\">Israeli armed forces killed children in the streets</a>. Israeli settlers shot Muhammad Hawashin, only 14 years old, in the face twice, killing him. He was walking with a group of women and children to visit a hospital in Jenin.</p>\n<p>They also killed Palestinians who were visibly disabled. Kamal Zghair, who was almost 60 and required a wheelchair, was first shot by the Israeli military and then run over by an army tank on April 10. According to a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/israel3/israel0502.pdf\">Human Rights Watch investigation</a>, when the Israelis killed Kamal, he was wheeling himself down the road to his home, carrying a white flag.</p>\n<p>When the Israelis took siege of Jenin, the theoretical designation of &quot;civilian&quot; didn't apply. They followed their old playbook, the <a href=\"https://imeu.org/article/plan-dalet\">1948 Plan Dalet model of engagement</a>: eliminate the Indigenous communities by any means necessary. On April 5, Israeli soldiers when to the home of Afaf Disuqi, knocked on his door, and when Afaf appeared, they detonated a bomb - mutilating his body in front of his family and community. According to reports, the soldiers laughed in public.</p>\n<p>Israeli soldiers carried out multiple summary executions. They killed Jamal Al-Sabbagh while ordering him to take off his clothes. They murdered 22-year-old Munthir al-Haj, and were about to watch him bleed to death as he attempted to drag himself into a nearby hospital. Becoming impatient, an Israeli soldier opened fire from a military tank.</p>\n<p>On April 6, the Israeli military fired missiles from helicopters into residential areas. This wanton directive led to the killing of a Palestinian woman in her home, and injuring another 4-year-old. Israel's rampant bombing and the bulldozing of people's homes destroyed over 140 buildings, and another 200 others were damaged so badly they were no longer safe to live in. With the intention of inflicting extreme damage, the military was literally crushing people under the rubble when bulldozing the homes over. Israeli bulldozers ran over Jamal Fayid, a paralyzed man in his house, killing him in the process. Muhammad Abu Saba'a, 65 years old, begged the military to stop destroying his home with his family inside. The Israeli shot and killed him. This absolute nightmare that the Israeli military enacted on the geographically small, highly populated community of Jenin camp left over 25% of the people homeless.</p>\n<p>And while this litany of Israeli killings in Jenin has shaped the lives of untold Palestinians, it has not rendered the Palestinians powerless or their allies hopeless.</p>\n<p>As we remember the Jenin massacre twenty years on in the wake of renewed, targeted violence in Jenin and across Historic Palestine, we know that coordinated resistance is essential to bring us into a just future. Through the Palestinian-led <a href=\"http://defundracism.org/\">Campaign to Defund Racism</a>, we are not just advocating structural change for policies that can lay the groundwork for decolonization; we are also building global networks based on principled solidarity and a shared vision of a world in which all people are equal. While these periods of heightened violence and death can make us feel disempowered, they also remind us of the urgency of action — the crucial nature of our call to disrupt colonization and elimination of Indigenous Palestinian.</p>\n<p>Your support is essential to be able to continue the urgent, deeply needed work of disrupting settler-colonialism and the violence it requires to carry on.</p>\n<p>We wish to commemorate those killed this week by Israeli forces.

Good Shepherd Collective joined to document an event organized by the women of Youth of Sumud and community members. The event included an opportunity for local children to gather in the community tent, express themselves creatively, dance, and play. This is one of the many weeks of organized gatherings to come in the village of Mufagara, as the community has requested a weekly presence in order to protect their lands.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Shepherds4Good/status/1442849735254192139\">On September 28</a>, Israeli settlers swarmed the village of al Mufagara as part of a series of organized attacks across Masafer Yatta. At least fifty settlers attacked the small village, slashing tires and throwing huge stones through windows in homes and cars and attacking men, women, and children indiscriminately. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Shepherds4Good/status/1446053908246409225\">Three year old Muhammad Hamamdeh</a> was one of the children injured in the attack, as a settler threw a rock through his home's window and hit him in the head, leading to his immediate hospitalization. Muhammad is out of the hospital and in stable condition now, but there is no doubt that he and many of the other children will retain traumatic memories of the brutal attack.</p>\n<p>In the wake of the attack on September 28, Palestinians, internationals, and Israelis gathered in solidarity with the people of Mufagara and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Shepherds4Good/status/1444215165520650241\">marched from Atuwani to Mufagara.</a> Palestinian activists continued the march toward the settlement of Havat Ma'on in a display of nonviolent resistance to colonial forces, illustrating that their steadfast connection to the land will not be severed. Still, we know that individual protests are not enough to halt settler-colonialism or protect vulnerable lands from colonization. In order to truly be in solidarity with the people at the highest level of risk for forced displacement, we must answer the call when they request coordination to empower them in their own spaces — not only providing a protective presence, but finding ways to make their homes more secure and able to resist violence in the long term.</p>\n<p>This intention, rooted in a dedication to finding meaningful ways to empower Palestinians to remain in their ancestral lands, was the force behind the gathering in Mufagara on Saturday and Youth of Sumud's event for the children. The organizers offered a number of activities for about twenty local children, including organizing an art project, hanging flags and signs, playing games, singing and dancing. The children also helped hang decorations and write signs about the land and resistance, reminding themselves that they have a right to live in peace on their family's lands and feel safe and secure there. Although this in itself is not enough to secure the communities the children are growing up in, we cannot expect to win big, international battles like the <a href=\"http://defundracism.org\">Campaign to Defund Racism</a> if we cannot make time to build spaces for joy and remind ourselves and those around us what kind of future we are building together.</p>\n<p>If you are in Palestine, please consider joining in solidarity with the people of al Mufagara as they continue their efforts to resist settler-colonialism by joining in person to show your support.

The Israeli military (IOF) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Shepherds4Good/status/1431194747138453504\">arrested Haj Suleiman al-Hathaleen of Um al Khair</a> and detained several media members. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://defundracism.org/questions-and-answers/\">Campaign to Defund Racism</a> is a Palestinian-led movement to stop the systematic exploitation of US-based charities and their financing of apartheid and Palestinian displacement. The racist nature of these settler organizations can be seen and experienced across the South Hebron Hills and the Old City of Hebron. In the Old City of Hebron, Palestinians live in distinct ethnic enclaves continually surveilled by the Israeli state and military, while Jewish settlers roam freely under the protection of the IOF. The remaining Palestinian communities and families suffer from daily settler and IOF harassment. As Palestinians navigate a matrix of physical violence, they must fight lawsuits filed by settler organizations intended to cleanse them from the land and take over their properties. </p>\n<p>The protest was coordinated with the <a href=\"https://defundracism.org/floridians-tell-duty-free-americas-stop-funding-expulsion-of-palestinians/\">Boycott Duty Free Americas Campaign</a> to raise awareness and stop the flow of money that the owners - the Falic Family - donate each year to the Israeli settler movement. Their institutions donate millions each year to settler organizations, including Elad, Ateret Cohanim, and Hebron right-wing organization - &quot;Fund for the Saving of the People of Israel&quot; (Hakeren l'Hatsalat Am Israel) directly or through the Segal Foundation located in Hebron. The Falic family chaired the Friends of the IDF and are supporters of former Israeli Prime Benjamin Netanyahu. </p>\n<p>&quot;What we see in the South Hebron Hills, especially across Masafer Yatta, is that we will continue to fight and stay on our lands. We will protest in meaningful ways, ways which call on our supporters to dismantle the Israeli settler structure,&quot; said Sami Huraini of the activist group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/youthofsumud/posts/891672934828949\">Youth of Sumud, based in Atwuani South Hebron Hills</a>. &quot;This is why we are calling on Palestinian solidarity groups to engage in this campaign. The colonization of our lands starts and ends with the settlers.”</p>\n<p>The Campaign to Defund Racism aims to halt the flow of US charitable money to violent and racist settler organizations. The campaign targets five organizations responsible for Palestinians' ongoing displacement and Nakba in Jerusalem, Hebron, Jordan valley, and the Naqab. The list includes American Friends of Ateret Cohanim, American Friends of Ir David, Israel Independence Fund, Central Fund of Israel, and Hebron Fund. The Campaign to Defund Racism was launched at the beginning of August by a coalition of Palestinian NGOs, village councils, and grassroots activists. </p>\n<p>Among the activists from the coalition from the village of Atuwani, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/youthofsumud/posts/891720254824217\">Hamoudi</a>, said of the campaign, &quot;We've been building this united movement to call for defunding these organizations because we will not be silenced.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;What we are witnessing with this Campaign to Defund Racism is just the natural continuation of events from this summer and Palestinian unity that rose to defend al-Aqsa, Sheikh Jarrah, and Silwan. They understand the key role that Israeli settler organizations play in financing their oppression, and they want it to end. But more importantly, Palestinian society understands when they project their power through a voice of unity,&quot; said Cody O'Rourke of the Good Shepherd Collective, one of the small grassroots organizations in the coalition. &quot;They realize that this campaign is already totally different from previous campaigns that have been filed with the IRS. Palestinians understand that New York Attorney General Letitia James has the power to revoke the charitable status of these organizations like the Central Fund of Israel. They realize that a public affairs campaign that mobilizes her constituents can encourage her to make the moral decision.”</p>\n<p>To learn more about the <a href=\"https://defundracism.org/\">Campaign to Defund Racism</a>, visit the website at defundracism.org.</p>\n<p>The South Florida Coalition for Palestine is coordinating the Boycott Duty Free Americas campaign.

In order to counter this attack on Palestinian land, GSC returned last week and planted more olive trees in the garden. This commitment to secure the land was lead by the local Palestinians and their centuries of experience in farming and protecting the land, even in the midst of near-constant attacks and destruction.</p>\n<p>The Sumud Freedom Garden serves as the border between Atuwani’s remaining land and the area that has been colonized by the settlers of Ma’on and Havat Ma’on. The remaining holes where the uprooted olive trees once stood illustrate the settlers willingness to use physical force against Palestinian property. But they also served as a symbol for the reality of settler-colonialism, in which law is not a means to justice, but rather for the expansion of colonial control. The settlers chose to steal olive trees belonging to the people of Atuwani not because they are fundamentally unable to grow their own, or because they cannot afford to buy olive trees, but because their ability to continue to colonize land and appropriate Palestinian history depends on how effectively they can strip Palestinians of their resources. </p>\n<p>This violence against property in Atuwani must be placed in the larger context of settler violence. Whether it comes in the form of attacks against children walking home from school, or baseless accusations against Palestinian activists designed to weaken their work, the threat follows the residents of the village in their daily routines. And yet, despite the endless challenges, Palestinians persist.</p>\n<p>While the Israeli military bulldozes homes and stores, confiscates Palestinian resources, restricts their travel, and continuously works at displacement, Palestinians continue to resist—perhaps most importantly by teaching life. The traditional craft of olive tree planting, as the tree, is rooted in the connection to the land and its needs for a sustainable environment. As such, the Sumud Freedom Garden also stands in stark contrast to the monoculture of cherry trees in the settlement meters away. Unlike the olives which serve the communities needs, the cherry plantation follows the economic logic of exploiting stolen land for the maximum profit. Learning how to prepare the land for the olive tree from one of the village elders, in this light, was more than just learning the steps of planting a tree. Working together on the land, among local women, children, and dedicated activists, was a way to reconnect to the community's history and its roots. </p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Meaningful Resistance to Settler Attacks On December 24, 2020, Israeli settlers uprooted and stole 34 olive trees from the Sumud Freedom Garden in Atuwani, including 24 trees provided and planted by Good Shepherd Collective and our international partners.

Although the campaign began as an effort to assist Palestinian farmers during the olive harvest—a contentious period filled with violence and harassment by Israeli settlers as many attempts to destroy the Palestinian olive crop—it has continued beyond the main period of the harvest to rebuild demolished Palestinian structures and bring aid and solidarity where they are needed.</p>\n<p>Khirbet Homsa is a Bedouin village in the Jordan Valley, a region that was under threat of immediate annexation by Israel earlier this year. Although the explicit threat has quieted, for now, it is clear that the Israeli politicians have no intention of letting go of this highly fertile region, with regular demolition operations and sprawling settlements in the region. Rather, Israeli forces—be they military or civilian—continue to tighten their grip on the Jordan Valley.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/goodshepherdcollective/posts/746796422574983\">On November 3</a>, Israeli military forces carried out a huge demolition in the village of Khirbet Humsa, decimating much of the local infrastructure. The demolition included homes, tents, barns, solar panels, restrooms, water tanks, and more. It impacted over seventy people, more than half of whom are children. Luckily, shortly after the demolition process, volunteers arrived with material assistance. </p>\n<p>The Israeli military chose this time, in the middle of a pandemic and difficult economic period for Palestinians to carry out this act of destruction. As calculated and disastrous as this event has been, it is not an evil unique to Israel—this is what settler-colonial regimes do. They use moments of chaos and vulnerability to displace and dispossess the indigenous population, steal resources, and extend their reach into desirable territories. Just the day after this rebuilding, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/youthofsumud/posts/714720409190870\">settlers from Havat Ma’on in the South Hebron HIlls attempted to evict a Palestinian family from the village of al Rakeez and take over their home</a> it was only when other local residents arrived that they were able to subdue the settlers. On Friday, the volunteers worked to plant new plants in the village as well as build up the irrigation system to prevent flooding in the village during the rainy season. This is what is important: Palestinians and allies standing together despite the particularly challenging hardship of the moment. It is not just about home demolitions—it is about people across boundaries coming together to rebuild for and protect the dozens of community members who need shelter and infrastructure this winter. It is about showing up for your neighbor not only because they need you to do so, but because it is a politically meaningful act. The Palestinian practice of <em>sumud</em> (steadfastness) is not merely a result of some inherent, stubborn nature—it exists because of the political actions by which we remind each other that we are here, we deserve to be here, and we will help one another remain and work against colonial forces with our time, energy, and resources. </p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last Friday, Good Shepherd Collective joined our partners in resistance on the ground in the village of Khirbet Homsa, recently the site of the largest Israeli demolition in years.The rebuilding was a part of the Faz3a campaign, a campaign that highlights the Palestinian harvest tradition of communities helping one another out during this demanding period.

These are not random acts of aggression, but targeted violence against one of the strongest aspects of the Palestinian economy—the olive harvest and the creation and sale of olive oil. As with all settler-colonial regimes, Israeli settlers work to destroy the indigenous economy in order to usurp it entirely, forcing Palestinians to abandon their lands or sell them out of financial distress, or at least become dependent on the Israeli economy.</p>\n<p>It is clear that in order to stay on their lands and continue to participate in their own economy, Palestinians need our support. Staying on land also means working the land and making the Palestinian presence on it clear, in order to prevent settler land grabs and attempts to confiscate by the Israeli military.</p>\n<p>After a few months of fundraising to purchase and plant young olive trees in vulnerable Palestinian spaces, GSC partnered with Youth of Sumud to place the first set of olive trees at a site in Atuwani, located right on the border between the little village, the settlement of Ma’on, and its neighboring outpost, Havat Ma’on.</p>\n<p>Atuwani is a small hamlet in the South Hebron Hills located off of Road 317. It is a short distance from the neighboring villages of al Tuba and al Mufagarah. Beside the village—built on land belonging to the village and its residents—is the sprawling Israeli settlement Ma’on, with its European-style homes and cherry plantation, and the neighboring outpost of Havat Ma’on built atop Tel Atuwani (Atuwani hill). For many years Atuwani has been and continues to be subjected to settler attacks, land confiscations, and demolition orders. Today, the village is still threatened by military incursions and threats against new construction.</p>\n<p>The violence of the settlers surrounding Atuwani village has reached such a point that since 2004, Palestinian children, traveling a short distance from the nearby villages to get to the school in Atuwani, have had to be accompanied by international volunteers and Israeli military in order to take the shortest and most direct path to school—about twenty-five minutes long. Before these accompaniments were a series of attacks against the children by settler groups living nearby, forcing the children to walk two hour long, indirect paths to school that circumvented the illegal Israeli settlements.</p>\n<p>While we worked, the children heading home from school waited almost an hour in between Atuwani and the two Israeli settler spaces for their military accompaniment to arrive. Youth of Sumud activists, familiar with the practice, informed us that the military is almost always late to accompany the children, and occasionally does not arrive at all, leaving students to fend for themselves.</p>\n<p>The land in which we planted the young olive trees yesterday sits just beside the dirt road separating Atuwani from Ma’on and Havat Ma’on. For many years, settlers have come to cut down and attempt to destroy the many olive trees which the community of Atuwani plants in this land, situated on a large and hilly field. The evidence is in the trees that remain to grow back, short and squat and without olives, but still there. This violence by settlers in the neighboring outposts is not only economic—it is an attempt to erase the Palestinian presence and drive the community out of these lands, clearing it for settlement expansion.</p>\n<p>Together with the organizers from Atuwani, GSC planted our eleven olive trees in a row. Hafez Huraini, who led us in the process, estimated that the trees—about three or four years old today—might bear olives in a few years, as long as they are left to grow and thrive where they have been planted. These olive trees, donated by those who understand the importance of indigenous communities and spaces, are more than olive trees, just as the act of planting them is more than what it seems. Together, we are doing the things we must in order to build the future we want—working to secure Palestinian spaces and economy with our partners, and investing into these communities in ways that support their needs.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Youth of Sumud, GSC start work on settlement buffer zone Armed with about a dozen olive trees, a wheelbarrow, and some buckets, pickaxes, and hoes, GSC members and local Youth of Sumud organizers from the village of Atuwani in the South Hebron Hills set out yesterday to resist settler-colonialism through farming.
